# 🍎 Fruit Jar App

**Fruit Jar App** is a simple React application built with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and React Query. The app allows users to browse and select fruits, add them to a jar, and view the total calories of the selected fruits. The app is developed using modern tools like Vite for fast builds and ESLint for linting.

## 🚀 Features

- Displays fruits grouped by `Family`, `Order`, or `Genus` with collapsible headers.
- Two view modes: **List** and **Table**.
- Add fruits individually or by group to a "fruit jar".
